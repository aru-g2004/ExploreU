This is the repo of the app I have published on the Google Play Store called ExploreU!
#
ExploreU is an educational platform where children can learn unique subjects including clay sculpting, designing, baking, cooking, and more as we update the app in the future. Our app also features a gallery where users can show their learning by posting pictures of their creations. With this app, we hope to provide children all over the world, an opportunity to learn subjects that are unique, important, and fun! Download the app and start exploring now!
